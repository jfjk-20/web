            “People like to think computers are not human, very cold and logical, but the fact is that computers are built by humans. 
            There's human constructs and imagination inside them”

         <p>If we only think of technology as machines for doing things, rather than a way of seeing things differently, 
            We miss out on many of the lessons it has to teach us. 
         </p>
         <p>
           I think it's fascinating that just at this moment of deep environmental change, the technological challenge we're most obsessed with is creating artificial intelligence, a whole new level of abstraction that not only distances us further from the planet, but might displace us entirely, because in the last few decades, we've learned more and more about other kinds of intelligence in the world around us.

           We've given legal personhood to apes and elephants who display such intricate ways of thinking that they must be deserving of rights too. We're just starting to see the ways in which squids and octopuses and colonies and bacteria display complex forms of behaviour that differ and, in some ways, exceed our own. 
        </p>
         <p> Even trees, it turns out, communicate over long distances, coordinate their actions and feed and care for one another. </p>
         <p>
           What if instead of replacing us, AI is here to teach us how to engage with, think with and care for intelligences other than our own to challenge the anthropocentrism that has gotten us into this mess in the first place and to suggest a way out of it.
